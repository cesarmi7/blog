                        Tokyo has two main airports, 
                        <a href="https://rb.gy/y35vqt" target="_blank">Narita</a> 
                        and

                        I arrived at Narita Airport, 
                        which is approximately an hour away from the metropolitan area of Tokyo. 
                        After exiting immigration, on the ground floor, you'll find bus agencies where 
                        you can purchase tickets for destinations around Narita and the Tokyo metropolitan area.
                        The bus ticket from Narita to Tokyo costs around 17 to 25 US dollars.

                        Additionally, if you go downstairs, you'll find the train station where you can take multiple trains. 
                        Don't worry about getting lost; you'll see a big sign saying "Train." Don't be afraid to ask for help if you need it.                        
                        The most popular ones are the Narita Express or the Skyliner to 
                        <a href="https://tinyurl.com/mpbf75zn" target="_blank">Tokyo Central Station</a>.

                        There are innumerable neighborhoods in Tokyo where you might want to stay. 
                        Where to stay can vary depending on your main interests, 
                        with options ranging from opulent hotels to reasonably priced hostels such as:

                        Personally, as a solo traveler, I prefer staying in hostels because I know that in such places, 
                        I'll always encounter people who may become friends for a lifetime.
                        During my time in Tokyo, I made the decision to stay at 
                        <a href="http://tinyurl.com/y6p8r3cb" target="_blank">Guesthouse Toco</a>
                        , a beautifully renovated guesthouse with a century-old history.

                        atmosphere made it easy to strike up interesting conversations with other travelers. 
                        The guesthouse draws a crowd of people from all over the world.

                        I personally enjoyed my time relaxing and chatting with other travelers in the charming garden. 
                        The location is convenient, just a few minutes' walk from the station and a short distance from

                        offering a peak of the beauty created by the contrast of temples, 
                        shrines, and homes side by side. The hostel also provides a breakfast option for 500 yen, 
                        approximately 3.35 US dollars. What can I say? It was delicious.

                        I also had the opportunity to stay for about 3 days in 
                        <a href="http://tinyurl.com/bdebpncv" target="_blank">Edogawa City</a> 
                        because I wanted to experience 
                        life in a place not too far nor too close to the main metropolis. To be honest, I was very curious 
                        about the place with the same name like the famous author and critic

                        from the morning when kids leave for school until the evening when adults come home from work. Its understatedly 
                        beautiful streets constantly brought to mind TV shows like

                        One of my favorite activities was having breakfast and dinner in the park in front of the apartment where I stayed. 
                        I always bought a salmon onigiri, another one with tuna and mayonnaise, and a coffee. I sat and appreciated the 
                        serenity of the place, listening to the birds in the morning, and in the evenings, the cats would come out to chat.

                        is a district located in the ward of 
                        <a href="http://tinyurl.com/2s3sbjh3" target="_blank">Taito City</a>. 
                        It is mostly known for its famous Buddhist temple, 
                        <a href="http://tinyurl.com/3nt5c385" target="_blank">Senso-ji</a>
                        , which is the oldest temple in Tokyo. Asakusa itself is a very touristy 
                        and popular place due to its 
                        traditional shopping streets, such as 
                        <a href="http://tinyurl.com/bdfdknxw" target="_blank">Nakamise-dori</a>, 
                        where you can find 
                        numerous souvenir shops and food stalls. That's why it's very common to see 
                        a lot of people in this area, but despite that, it is very colorful and has 
                        an incredible atmosphere. In this area, you will often see people wearing 
                        traditional clothing, and I love that some locals go there just to practice their 
                        English with foreigners.

                        Senso-ji and Asakusa, in general, are very close to 
                        <a href="http://tinyurl.com/293u2b6a" target="_blank">Tokyo Skytree</a>, 
                        which offers 
                        wonderful views of the city, but it has an entrance fee of 3,100 yen for people 
                        over 18 years old. An entirely free option is to go to the 
                        <a href="http://tinyurl.com/yc33t42v" target="_blank">Asakusa Culture Tourist Information Center</a> 
                        and take the elevator to the seventh or eighth floor, 
                        where the entrance is free, and you can take very nice photos of the area. 
                        But have in mind that visiting Tokyo Skytree is a wonderful experience in every sense.

                        overwhelming presence of crowds, I suggest exploring the area at night. 
                        The nighttime tranquility provides a unique perspective, with no more than 
                        10 people scattered throughout the entire area, highlighting the immensity

                        Shinjuku is more than its bustling streets and neon lights. It's a district where the past and the present merge, where the vibrancy of its nightlife 
                        is balanced by the tranquility of its hidden gems. The views from Shinjuku's skyscrapers at dusk, as the city begins to sparkle, are a testament to Tokyo's 
                        endless allure.

                        a history-telling story, and every path telling of the fusion of

                        about their daily lives. Shiba is a chapter in Tokyo's book that promises a

                        I spent the entire day searching 
                        and checking out different stores to compare prices and differences between consoles. Just keep in mind that Akihabara 
                        is in the capital, and tends to have higher prices for these kinds of items. In other cities, I found figures and consoles 
                        at lower prices.

                        And my special recommendation is to go to the 
                        <a href="https://tinyurl.com/23dhw5pd" target="_blank">Art Aquarium Museum</a>. 
                        You could look at each aquarium and be amazed by its majestic simplicity. 
                        Without a doubt this type of art is wonderful and breathtakig that can 
                        leave anyone perplexed. Each tank contains a small world where goldfish 
                        dance in rhythmic synchrony. It is illuminated under a soft light, and these 
                        living sculptures swim in a kind of chaos that is charming at the same time, 
                        bringing peace to the soul.
